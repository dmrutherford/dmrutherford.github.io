		<h1>Coming Soon&hellip;</h1>
		
		<p>I&rsquo;ve finally got around to starting an account at GitHub, so that I can share my awful code with the world. I&rsquo;ll be putting a proper site up here shortly (a <q>proper</q> site!) but in the meantime you&rsquo;ll have to live with this unsightly monster.</p>
		
		<p>Better yet, don&rsquo;t hang around here: <a href="http://www.dmrutherford.com">come visit me at my blog</a>! I don&rsquo;t bite; I just make bad jokes.</p>
