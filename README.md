*Where bad code comes to die.*


A place to noodle about with Jekyll and write about stuff that&rsquo;s overly
technical to fit with the rest of the content on my main blog, [The View from
Nobody](http://www.dmrutherford.com/).

As a disclaimer, much of the code up here is inelegant and inefficient. However,
I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from looking at how other people approach problems,
and I hope that this will prove useful to somebody.

If you can&rsquo;t do, teach; and if you can&rsquo;t teach, blog about it.
