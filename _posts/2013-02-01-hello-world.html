<p><q>First post</q>. Don&rsquo;t you just hate it when commenters say that? Anyway, this is my first post up here. I am aware &ndash; in case you were wondering &ndash; that <cite class="subpart">hello world</cite> is a pretty uninspired title.</p>

<p>As an attempt at justifying it, I thought I might actually include some sample <code>hello world</code> programs. Taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">Wikipedia</a>, since it&rsquo;s not like I know how to write most of these myself&hellip;</p>

<h2>C</h2>

{% highlight c %}
main()
 {
        printf("hello, world");
 }
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><abbr class="acronym">HTML</abbr></h2>

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
    Hello, world!
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>(That one I did know how to write. Honest.)</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

{% highlight javascript %}
document.write('Hello, world!');
{% endhighlight %}

<p>(Also that one.)</p>

<h2><abbr class="acronym">PHP</abbr></h2>

{% highlight php %}
<?php echo 'Hello, world!' ?>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>(And that one.)</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

{% highlight python %}
print("Hello, world!")
{% endhighlight %}

<p>(I vaguely remembered this one.)</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello, world!"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Well done(?) for reading this far. My aim in starting this second blog (I&rsquo;m normally found at the <a href="http://www.dmrutherford.com/">View from Nobody</a> was to create a space where I could write more in depth about my encounters with tech. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to fit with the rest of my usual content.</p>

<p>Check back for more updates in the coming weeks. I have a few things lined up on the subject of <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> &ndash; both of which I&rsquo;m new to, and both of which I&rsquo;ve been hugely impressed with so far&hellip;</p>

<p>For now, stay classy.</p>
