<q>First post</q>. Don&rsquo;t you just hate it when commenters say that?
Anyway, this is my first post up here. I am aware -- in case you were wondering,
-- that <cite class="subpart">hello world</cite> is a pretty uninspired title.

As an attempt at justifying it, I thought I might actually include some sample
`hello world` programs. Taken from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program), since it&rsquo;s
not like I know how to write most of these myself&hellip;


C
-

```c
main()
 {
        printf("hello, world");
 }
```


<abbr class="acronym">HTML</abbr>
---------------------------------

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
Hello, world!
</body>
</html>
```

(That one I did know how to write. Honest.)


JavaScript
----------

```javascript
document.write('Hello, world!');
```

(Also that one.)


<abbr class="acronym">PHP</abbr>
--------------------------------

```php
<?php echo 'Hello, world!' ?>
```

(And that one.)


Python
------

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

(I vaguely remembered this one.)


Ruby
----

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
```

Well done(?) for reading this far. My aim in starting this second blog
(I&rsquo;m normally found at [The View from Nobody](http://www.dmrutherford.com)
was to create a space where I could write more in depth about my own encounters
with tech. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to fit with the rest of my usual content.

Check back for more updates in the coming weeks. I have a few things lined up on
the subject of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
&ndash; both of which I&rsquo;m new to, and both of which I&rsquo;ve been hugely
impressed with so far&hellip;

For now, stay classy.
